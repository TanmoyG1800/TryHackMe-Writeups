## Let's start !!

First, we set an IP variable

````````
export IP=10.10.63.149
````````

### Rustscan 

As always we start with rustscan I like its style and it instantly gives a response after discovering an open port. The drawback is that we cannot scan it for UDP.

````````
rustscan -a $IP -- -A -sC -oN nmap.txt
````````

Nmap? More like slowmap.üê¢

[~] The config file is expected to be at "/root/.rustscan.toml"
[!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
[!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'.

So we have 3 ports open 21(FTP) ,22(ssh) ,80(HTTP). First, let's check what is in FTP...

Here we found a file called note_to_jake. let us see what is inside. in note_to_jake.txt we found a name, Jake. let's bruteforce it. 

### Hydra (ssh)
